# Hidden pearls for High-Performance-Persistence

Small UseCases with a significant amount of data for internal company usage, most developers had this in their career, already. 
However, no Ops Team, no Kubernetes, no Cluster is available as part of the solution.

dealing with the classic horizontal scaling tech monsters like Kubernetes, Hadoop and many more. 

Sit down, relax and enjoy the journey through a bunch of lightning-fast persistence alternatives for pure java devs.
